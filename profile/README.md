# NHCarrigan + freeCodeCamp 2025 Hackathon

Naomi ran a month-long hackathon in the freeCodeCamp community. There were 20 teams that worked very hard all month to create production-ready real-world fullstack applications.

This organisation holds a copy of those projects **captured at the end of the hackathon**. We preserve this organisation so participants can look back on their achievement, and all they accomplished in just one month.

Participants have been encouraged to continue working on their projects together, so they can keep building those collaboration skills and have something really cool on their resume. With this in mind, our copies are specifically forks that link back to the original repository where participants have continued collaborating after the event.

We encourage you to check out their continued progress in [the original organisation](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp-2025-Summer-Hackathon).
